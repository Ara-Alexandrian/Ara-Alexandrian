### Salutations, Digital Nomad! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ara Alexandrian

By day, I navigate the labyrinthine realms of radiation oncology as a Medical Physicist. By nightfall, I transmute into a code alchemist, forging scripts to decipher the arcane in clinical research. Amidst the known and the uncharted, I venture into radiotherapy scripting, with eyes set on the elusive horizons of tech unknown.

ðŸ›  **Current Arsenal (Tech Stack)**  
- **Scripting Sorcery (Programming Languages):** 
  - Python (.py, .ipynb) â€“ My cipher for radiotherapy enigmas and data realms
  - C# â€“ The chisel for software sculpting
- **Virtual Vessels (Containerization & Virtualization):** 
  - Docker â€“ The crucible for concocting container brews
  - WSL2 â€“ The bridge across the chasm betwixt Windows and Linux
- **Data Alchemy (Data Science & Machine Learning):** 
  - A blend of libraries and frameworks â€“ Heeding the call of medical physics
- **Parallel Potency (High-Performance Computing):** 
  - CUDA 11/12 â€“ Channeling the tempest of parallel computation

ðŸ”¬ **Current Endeavours (Projects)**
- Unveiling the obscured in ROILS incident analysis through the lens of Machine Learning Models (LLM).
- Exploring the nexus of LLM integrations in clinical research, delving into the potential for automated insights and enhanced decision-making.
- [Venture forth... (More about my projects)](https://github.com/Ara-Alexandrian?tab=repositories)


ðŸ’¡ **Open Horizons (I'm open to)**
- Forging alliances on quests profound in radiotherapy, oncology, or medical physics.
- Exchanging blades of thought on avant-garde approaches to clinical and theoretical enigmas in radiation oncology.
